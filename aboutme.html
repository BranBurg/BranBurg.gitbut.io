 <p>Let me tell you a story about someone who has had quite a journey in their career. His name is Brandon Burgener. He worked for a Sheriff’s Office as a Sergeant for several years, but after burning out of that line of work, he wanted to find something different that he was passionate about. While searching, he got another offer to be a Program Manager for another agency to run their field training and academy program. After another year, he was ready to leave the state government and enter the corporate foray. He joined Uber as a Senior Trust and Safety Investigator, and after some hard work, he was promoted to Global Talent Acquisition as a Recruiting Sourcer. He enjoyed his work and found professional happiness for the first time. He was able to look ahead and towards his future plans.

     In 2023, Uber announced layoffs and redundancies, and Brandon's entire team was affected. He took this opportunity to search again for what he wanted. He ended up where he should have always begun: information technology. He has always been interested in technology, from gaming to tinkering to enjoying the latest tech. He was always his family’s IT guy. After some deliberation, he figured that he should finally get paid for his services, and he is now pursuing his degree in Information Technology and Cyber Security. This journey has taught him a lot, and he looks forward to learning more.

     But there has always been something that holds him back—his fitness. Starting a fitness journey can be a daunting task, but it’s also an exciting one. It’s a chance to take control of your health and well-being and to make positive changes in your life. While pursuing his professional goal, he wants to challenge himself and pursue his fitness goals. He believes that fitness is not just about looking good, but it’s also about feeling good. It’s about having the energy to do the things you love and to live life to the fullest.
     
     Brandon is excited to embark on this new journey and to see where it takes him. He knows that it will not be easy, but he is ready to put in the work and make positive changes in his life. He’s excited to take control of his health and well-being and to inspire others to do the same. If you are ready to start your own fitness journey, Brandon is here to help you every step of the way</p>
