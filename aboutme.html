 <h2>About me!</h2>
  <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I want to share my story with you. I've had quite a journey in my career.
     My name is Brandon Burgener. I worked for a Sheriff’s Office as a Sergeant for several years,
     but I burned out of that line of work and wanted to find something different that I was passionate about.
     While searching, I got another offer to be a Program Manager for another agency to run their field training and academy program.
     After another year, I was ready to leave the state government and enter the corporate foray.</p>
<div class="paraspace">
</div> 
   <p style="text-indent: 25px;">I joined Uber as a Senior Trust and Safety Investigator, and after some hard work, I was promoted to Global Talent Acquisition as a Recruiting Sourcer.
     I enjoyed my work and found professional happiness for the first time.
     I was able to look ahead and towards my future plans.
     In 2023, Uber announced layoffs and redundancies, and my entire team was affected.
     I took this opportunity to search again for what I wanted. I ended up where I should have always begun: information technology. I've always been interested in technology, from gaming to tinkering to enjoying the latest tech.
     I was always my family’s IT guy. After some deliberation, I figured that I should finally get paid for my services, and I am now pursuing my degree in Information Technology and Cyber Security.</p>
<div class="paraspace">
</div>     
   <p style="text-indent: 25px;">This journey has taught me a lot, and I look forward to learning more. But there has always been something that holds me back&mdash;my fitness.
     Starting a fitness journey can be a daunting task, but it’s also an exciting one.
     It’s a chance to take control of my health and well-being and to make positive changes in my life.
     While pursuing my professional goal, I want to challenge myself and pursue my fitness goals.
     I believe that fitness is not just about looking good, but it’s also about feeling good.
     It’s about having the energy to do the things I love and to live life to the fullest.
     I'm excited to embark on this new journey and to see where it takes me.
     I know that it will not be easy, but I am ready to put in the work and make positive changes in my life.
     I’m excited to take control of my health and well-being and to inspire others to do the same.
     If you are ready to start your own fitness journey, I am here to help you every step of the way.</p>
