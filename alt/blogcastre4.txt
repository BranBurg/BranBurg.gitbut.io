Welcome everybody to the Blogcast, where today we will talk a little about Resident Evil 4: Remake. Now, In my short review I posted earlier in the blogcast thread on the Burgener Blog we dived into a little about what RE4:Remake is all about, but to recap:

Resident Evil 4: Remake is a stunning overhaul of the classic 2005 action-horror game that improves on almost every aspect of the original. The game follows Leon Kennedy, a former cop sent to rescue the presidentâ€™s daughter from a cult infected by a parasitic organism. The game features a thrilling and varied campaign with diverse enemies, environments, and puzzles. The dynamic combat system allows you to move and shoot simultaneously, use melee attacks, and interact with the surroundings. The game also boasts impressive graphics, sound, and voice acting, making the game more immersive and realistic.

The game has its flaws, however. Some fans may miss the original's cheesy dialogue and campy tone, which gave it a unique charm. The game also suffers from technical issues like long loading times, occasional frame drops, and minor bugs. The game also lacks some features in the original, such as the Mercenaries mode, the New Game Plus option, and the alternate costumes.

Overall, the Resident Evil 4 remake is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. It is a masterful remake that honors the legacy of the original while bringing it into the modern era. It is one of the best games of 2023.

That is going to do it for the Blogcast today. Thank you so much for tuning and I hope to see you next time.
