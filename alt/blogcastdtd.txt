Welcome everybody to the Blogcast, where today we will talk a little about Dave the Diver. 
In my short review I posted earlier in the blogcast thread on the Burgener Blog, we dived into a little about what Dave the Diver is all about, but to recap:

Dave the Diver is a charming and addictive pixel adventure that combines spearfishing, restaurant management, and quirky humor.
You play as Dave, a plump and reluctant diver who runs a sushi shop near the Blue Hole, a mysterious ocean that changes daily.
You will explore, fight, and collect fish and resources in the colorful and lively underwater world while also serving customers, crafting recipes, and hiring staff in your cozy and busy restaurant. 
The game is full of surprises, constantly introducing new features, activities, and secrets. 
You will also encounter a hilarious cast of characters, from your stoic sushi chef, Bancho, to your anime-loving gunsmith, Duff, to a secret society of merfolk and some discontented sea creatures.

The game’s graphics, sound, and voice acting are superb, creating a vibrant and immersive atmosphere. 
The game’s story is engaging and humorous, with plenty of twists and turns. 
The game’s gameplay is varied and satisfying, with different modes, challenges, and minigames. 
The game’s length is impressive, with over 30 hours of content and more to come. 
Dave the Diver is a gem of an indie game that will make you laugh, relax, and have fun. 
It is one of the hidden gems of 2023.

That is going to do it for the Blogcast today.
Thank you so much for tuning and I hope to see you next time.
